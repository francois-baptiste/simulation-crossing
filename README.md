This project is a simulator validating control algorithms for autonomous vehicles at intersections.

Currently only the longitudinal motion of the vehicles is modelled and the number of vehicles is limited to two.

This code requires `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

A simple simulation can be executed and analyzed using the following command:

    python demo.py

The result of one simple simulation can be seen [here](http://youtu.be/PcqIsDTMEl0)
